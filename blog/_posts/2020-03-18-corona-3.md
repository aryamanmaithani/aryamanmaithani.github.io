Day so far: had breakfast in the morning despite sleeping at like, 3:30 AM. Proud.  
Then, took a nap. Then, had lunch. Proud (2).  
Pretty much all I did so far. Maybe not so proud after all.  
Also, we got an email saying that we'll have to switch to a neighbouring hostel's mess. That sucks. Don't like walking. Fear that this may lead to me skipping meals. Hope not.  
Aim for the rest of the day: do some category theory.

Had snacks and dinner as well. Gonna have some chips now.  
Did end up doing the first chapter of Category Theory by Awodey.  
Today might not be so productive. We finally got the email that we have to leave. Bummer.  
Not panicking, though. Handled it smoothly. However, was sad that my total isolation experiment came to such an abrupt end.  

I guess that's all for the day. Huh. Ciao.

11:29 PM 22nd March  
So I guess I just skipped posting the last two days.  
Been less motivated at home for some reason.  
Almost did chapter two of category theory. Was an internet friend's birthday yesterday. Surprised him by having a conference call. Kaafi wholesome. :)  

Today and yesterday the only "productive" thing I did was check assignment submissions that I gave on my own. Feels like I unnecessarily created a lot of work for myself. It is fun to correct it, though. Feels like they've genuinely put effort. V nice. Was also able to get few to do it in $$\LaTeX$$, so that's an accomplishment. However, it also is extra work as I have also decided to correct their $$LaTeX$$ by going through the tex file and changing that. Hopefully, that'll be appreciated. _Oh, the things I do for validation._  

I have now also learnt how to send attachments in my mails using Python. So that'll make the job of emailing back assignments easier. Yay.  

Professors have been posting academic stuff on Moodle which I have been successfully ignoring. Uh oh. Hopefully I get around to being actually productive in the next few days.

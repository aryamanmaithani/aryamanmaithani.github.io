I am sometimes asked why I upload solutions and stuff, even for courses I'm not a TA for. I don't have to do that, even for the course I _am_ a TA for.  
Well, it's because I find it nice. I sometimes get appreciated for it, which I like. But even if I'm not explicitly thanked, I still find happiness in knowing that someone is probably helped by it.

__However,__ there are some, for whom it's never enough. So, not only is it not enough that they're getting solutions/notes for free, they _want more._ This is something that _irks_ me a lot. As an example, from [this page](/notes/ma-214/), I got

> "Bhai update kr na, or tutorial k solm bhi daal de, exam aa gaye"

in the form. (_"Bro update it no, and put tutorial solutions as well, exams have come."_)

This is one example of many similar such requests.   
There are also people who complain about all tutorial solutions being in one PDF because _it's much scrolling._  
So, not only are they getting solutions from me (which wasn't obligated), they are going to complain about something like scrolling on top of it.  
Sigh.

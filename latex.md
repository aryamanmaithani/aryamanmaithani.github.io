As you may have seen, I like $$\LaTeX$$. I encourage everyone to learn it.  
In my opinion, an efficient way of learning is to start making a document and googling the things along the way.  
To get started, I feel it's enough to just see one code and its output to get a sense of how it works. That's the point of this page.  
I would suggest you to first make an account (for free) on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). Then, you may see [this](https://www.overleaf.com/read/smxvxtpbvjht) file of mine.  
I think that that contains more or less everything basic needed to get started.  

Lastly, almost every LaTeX'd PDF on my repositories/website also has the source code uploaded. Simply changing the .pdf to .tex in the URL would do the job.

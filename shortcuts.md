This is applicable for Android phones. (With some possible finite exceptions.) For PC, see [this](https://github.com/notatyrannosaur/latex-replacements).  
One possible option is to use a math keyboard - many such are available on the Play Store. However, these tend to be a bit of a pain as it's cumbersome to switch. That's where this method comes in.  
Android phones have this option of setting up shortcuts for words. (You may look it up how it's done.) This is mainly to set up abbreviations for common words to increase the speed of typing. However, one can use this feature for math symbols as well and that's precisely what I've done.  
Here's how you can use my shortcuts:  
1. Download an app like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usr.dict.mgr) which lets you import dictionaries via .txt files.
2. Download [this](/files/latex-shortercuts.txt) text file which contains my shortcuts.
3. Import it using the app and you're done.

## Some things to know
* The symbols available can be accessed using their $$\LaTeX$$ commands but without the `\` symbol. If you want the ones with the `\` symbol, use [this](/files/latex-shortcuts.txt) file.  
* There is more than one shortcut available for some symbols to increase the ease. For example, $$\mathbb{R}$$ can be accessed via `BbbR`, `mathbb{R}`, or simply, `R`. (Correspondingly, `\BbbR`, `\mathbb{R}`, or `~R` in the other file.)  
It would be useful to go through the text file once and see the different shortcuts yourself.
* If there's something that you'd want to see added, you can let me know.

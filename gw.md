## Duties and responsibilities

        + allocation job is of conveners
        + other stuff, mostly managers
        + finding resources is __not__ the headache of conveners
    - 5 "quizzing" events
        + over the summer → question papers
            * understand questions, be clear with them
            * everyone should know their own question thoroughly
            * on top of that, the person responsible for the event should know the paper thoroughly
        + slides and all can happen later
        + hosts → conveners
    - Bazinga!s
        + professors → invite → incorporate the changes to Q paper, if any
            * good opportunity to go and talk
    - Mathathon/Logic GC/Bamboozled
        + not much to be said, type of work will be a subset of the type of work done in Bazinga!
    - Physics Detective
        + IRL prep usually a week before
        + think about experiments and order the stuff well in advance
    - Tech Expo (what's that?) → low prep
    - Lab Visits
        + find a suitable lab inside/outside institute
        + mail the person in-charge in advance and work out the details
        + hope that it goes through (make sure no Corona)
    - GDs
        + easiest
        + most fun

* (Manager + Secretary)'s role
    - mainly there to oversee stuff

* Things that happen in between:
    - GDs
    - Lectures/Talks
    - Lab visits → inside and outside
    - Movie screening(s)

## Events you probably didn't know about
* New events that could happen:
    - Integration Bee - MIT
    - Origami Workshop
    - Science Lit writing
* Circles
    - Within the community of seniors. 
    - Essentially like GDs but with clear prereqs.

## Ending
* How much time?
    - Not much.
    - Can academics be managed? Yes.
    - Can we be a TA as well? Duh.
* Fun fact: If you're late, you get fined.

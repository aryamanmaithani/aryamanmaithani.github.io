This is the webpage I maintained for sharing the resources of MA 105 when I was a TA for that course in Autumn 2019.  
I had the privilege of interacting with numerous first year students due to this opportunity for which I am forever grateful.  
I hope that this page will be helpful to whosoever is ever taking this course.

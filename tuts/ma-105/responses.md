Ayy, I'm glad you find them helpful!  
Also, thanks for not asking me for physics solutions, lol.

> "What about question 7 of tut sheet 6? what do they mean by bounded in a disc?"  
> \- CuriousFreshie  

Hello, what the question means is that given any $$\epsilon > 0$$ and any $$M \in \mathbb{R}$$, there will be a point $$(x_0, y_0)$$ in the disc of radius $$\epsilon$$ centered at origin such that the value of $$\mid f_x(x_0, y_0)\mid$$ is greater than $$M$$. (This is what is means for the derivative to *not* be *bounded* in any disc around $$(0, 0)$$.)

I'm glad you find it helpful. You're most welcome. No, I won't be uploading solutions for physics tuts. I don't have the time for an extra subject.

Thank you!

I'm not quite sure how you missed the solutions which are pretty much the highlight of the page.

> \- 

Hey, I'm glad you find the site helpful. However, I won't be uploading the solutions for extra questions. That would defeat the purpose of the questions. (Purpose being - you must think about them.)

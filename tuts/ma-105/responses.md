> "Tony forgot to ask Q9(ii) Sheet11. Please provide a solution for that too."  
> \- Thor Odinson

I guess MA 105 questions are an Avengers' level threat, huh?  
However, question 9 is indeed a nice question in my opinion. So, [here](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-105-tut/blob/master/Additional%20solutions/S11-Q09.pdf) you have the solution for all parts.

> \- Iron man 

Iron man is indeed correct. The typo has been fixed.

> "Please provide a solution for Sheet 10 Q11"  
> \- Iron man 

Surely Iron man shouldn't be having a problem with this.  
Anyway, [here's](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-105-tut/blob/master/Additional%20solutions/S10-Q11.pdf) the solution.

> "Can you please give the solution to Q7 Sheet 8?"  
> \- Freshie 

I *can* and I shall.  
By symmetry, the given volume is 8 times the volume in the positive octant.  
In that octant the volume lies above the region $$Q := \{(x, y, 0) \in \mathbb{R}^3 :x \ge 0, y \ge 0, x^2 + y^2 \le a^2\}$$ and underneath the cylinder given by $$x^2 + z^2 = a^2$$.  
Therefore,  
$$V = 8\displaystyle\int_0^a\left(\int_0^{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}\left(\int_0^{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}1dz\right)dy\right)dx = \dfrac{16a^3}{3}$$.

That's what I hoped to do. Glad to know I was successful :)

> \- Random Guy

You're welcome!  
P.S.: Nothing is stopping you from making your own solutions for your own batch. I'm sure that there are plenty of subjects for which solutions aren't being made.

> "Can a continuous function with bounded and open domain be. integrable "  
> \- A person who is going to revolutionize whole world 

Yes, it *can*. But it's not necessary. This is because a continuous function need not be bounded on a bounded and open domain. (Think of an example.)  
Hence, the function won't be integrable.

Ayy, I'm glad you find them helpful!  
Also, thanks for not asking me for physics solutions, lol.

> "What about question 7 of tut sheet 6? what do they mean by bounded in a disc?"  
> \- CuriousFreshie  

Hello, what the question means is that given any $$\epsilon > 0$$ and any $$M \in \mathbb{R}$$, there will be a point $$(x_0, y_0)$$ in the disc of radius $$\epsilon$$ centered at origin such that the value of $$\mid f_x(x_0, y_0)\mid$$ is greater than $$M$$. (This is what is means for the derivative to *not* be *bounded* in any disc around $$(0, 0)$$.)

Thanks a lot for pointing this out. Nice name!

> Hey!! great help. thanx a lot. a request. is it possible for you to upload solutions for phy tuts as well. thanx  
> \- 

I'm glad you find it helpful. You're most welcome. No, I won't be uploading solutions for physics tuts. I don't have the time for an extra subject.

Thank you!

> can you upload solutions of tutorial sheets??  
> \-

I'm not quite sure how you missed the solutions which are pretty much the highlight of the page.

> This site is very helpful. It would be nice if you could provide solution for extra question.  
> \- 

Hey, I'm glad you find the site helpful. However, I won't be uploading the solutions for extra questions. That would defeat the purpose of the questions. (Purpose being - you must think about them.)

Thanks, God.

> "They dont teach relativity in PH107 why because its ""difficult"" then  why do they are allowed and interested to teach a whole lot of difficult complicated and sophisticated things in MA105"  
> \- Artemis

Why they chose to not teach relativity in PH107 is not for me to judge. (Even though I am extremely happy that they don't. :))  
Coming to MA105, there was nothing "difficult complicated" that was taught. You will most likely use Calculus at some point of time in your courses here. So it is important to know the basic theory that builds up these concepts. If not, you'd be left with just some hand-wavy and half-baked-rigour-less knowledge of limits and the sort.  
Now you may argue that as an engineer (I'm assuming you're getting an engineering degree), you may not be required to know these fundamentals. In which case, I am saddened by your attitude.

Hehe, I'm not too surprised to know that it was just one person.  
It was fun having this little running gag. All the best for your exam!  
Maybe we shall continue this during the days of MA106 or MA108.

> "A friendly suggestion here. I feel that the tutorials can be improved a little bit by giving more focus to tutorials 11-14. They were rushed through in the last 2 weeks and given that they consist of such important topics, I feel they should be emphasized on more rather than giving so much time to differentiation and integration in multiple variables. Hope you take this into consideration. Good going with the website, it's really helpful. Thanks for everything :)"  
> \- Batman

Hey, I can see where you're coming from. I hope you entered this in your course feedback as I have no control over how these things go but raising this issue there may make a difference.  
As for the last part, you're most welcome :)

> "Could you please upload the solution of question 1, tut 13? Thanks!"  
> \- A confused nibba

Here's an outline for part (a):  
You most likely would be having trouble with parameterising the line integral part. Mainly because of a messy $$z$$ coordinate.  
Note that the line integral can be written as:  
$$\displaystyle\oint_C (x-y)dx + (x+y)dy + (y+z)dz = \oint_C xdy - ydx + \oint_C \nabla\left(yz + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + z^2)\right)\cdot d\mathbb{r}$$.  
The second line integral will simply be $$0$$ as it's a smooth grad field along a smooth closed loop. The first can now be simply done as you don't need to worry about $$z$$. The projection of that curve onto the XY-plane can be simply parameterised as $$\left(\frac{a}{2}\cos\theta, \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2}\sin\theta\right)$$. (Or you can observe this as twice the area of the projected circle.)  
For the surface integral part, note that $$\nabla\times\mathbf{F} = (0, 0, 2)$$.  
Note that the surface is part of the cone given by $$z = f(x, y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$. Thus, the normal is given as $$(-z_x, -z_y, 1)$$ which gives $$(\nabla\times\mathbf{F})\cdot\mathbb{n}=2$$. Now, find the appropriate domain for $$x$$ and $$y$$ to get the answer. (Same projection as last which would again give twice the area as the answer.)

> "When we write n.dS while evaluating surface integrals, do we take n to be unit vector in case of planes? And what exactly is dS?"  
> \- Clint Barton

$$\mathbf{n}$$ is always taken to be the unit vector at the point. It's just that $$\mathbf{n}$$ is constant in the case of planes.  
$$dS$$ is just notation, it does have any more meaning than that. In differential notation, we may also write $$dS = \|\Phi_u\times\Phi_v\|d(u, v)$$. Again, I'll emphasise that this is just notation.

> "Hey! Can you help me solve Q9(b) Sheet 14? And yes, please reply Bruce."  
> \- Natasha Romanoff

Consider $$ \psi = \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2}$$.  
Note that the outwards unit normal $$\mathbf{n}$$ at any point $$\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$$ on the ellipsoid is in the same direction as $$\nabla \psi$$ and one also has $$p = \mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n}$$. Also note that $$\mathbf{r}\cdot\nabla\psi=2$$. I will use these facts in the following equations. It is your task to see where I've used what and how.  
$$\displaystyle\iint_S\frac{1}{p}dS$$  
$$ = \displaystyle\iint_S\frac{1}{\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n}}dS$$  
$$ = \displaystyle\iint_S\frac{\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n}}dS$$  
$$ = \displaystyle\iint_S\left(\frac{\mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n}}\right)\cdot\mathbf{n}dS$$  
$$ = \displaystyle\iint_S\left(\frac{\nabla\psi}{\mathbf{r}\cdot\nabla\psi}\right)\cdot\mathbf{n}dS$$  
$$ = \displaystyle\iint_S\left(\frac{\nabla\psi}{2}\right)\cdot\mathbf{n}dS$$  
$$ = \displaystyle\iiint_W\frac{\nabla^2\psi}{2}dV$$  
$$ = \displaystyle\left(\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}\right)\iiint_W 1dV$$   
$$ = \displaystyle\frac{4}{3}\pi abc\left(\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}\right).$$  
Note that I have used Gauss' divergence theorem and the fact that the volume of $$W$$, the solid ellipsoid, is what it is.

Could you be more specific as to what you want? The alternate formulations are there in slides and I'm not sure as to what more I can tell about that.

---

> "Q9 Sheet 12 is making me turn green. Please help!"  
> \- Bruce Banner

Here's an outline of what to do. Hopefully you can complete it.  
The hemisphere satisfies $$z = \sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}$$ and $$x^2 + y^2 \le 1$$.  
Using the fact that $$\mathbf{n}dS = (-z_x, -z_y, 1)d(x, y)$$.  
In this case, $$z_x = -x/z$$ and $$z_y = -y/z$$.  
Thus, $$\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n}dS = \frac{1 - 2xy - 2y^2}{z}d(x, y).$$  
(Note that both the above equations involving $$dS$$ are just written in differential notation. I'm not treating $$dS$$ as a real number or any such thing.)  
Now the mass blah blah blah stuff asked is just the flux which equals:  
$$\displaystyle\iint_S\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n}dS = \iint_D{1 - 2xy - 2y^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}}d(x, y)$$.  
Where $$D = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 \le 1\}$$. The above can be solved using polar coordinates.

> "My Spidey Sense tells me that Q7 Sheet 10 is a threat. Can you help me fight it?"  
> \- Peter Parker

Good job giving away your identity.  
I'm not sure what exactly is the problem with this question, though. I guess you had a problem finding a parameterisation for the curve $$C$$ because it's quite straightforward otherwise.  
Note that the cylinder is given by $$\left(x-\frac{a}{2}\right)^{2}+y^{2}=\frac{a^{2}}{4}$$.  
The equation of the sphere tells us that the points lying on the intersection, that is, the points of $$C$$ satisfy: $$z^2 = a^2 - ax$$.  
The first equation leads to the natural parameterisation of $$x = \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2}\cos\theta$$ and $$y = \frac{a}{2}\sin\theta$$ where $$\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$$.  
Also, substituting this value of $$x$$ in the second equation and noting that $$z \ge 0$$ gives us that $$z = a\sin\frac{\theta}{2}$$.  
Thus, we now have a parameterisation for the curve and can (hopefully) easily solve it now.  
You just need to compute the integral $$\oint_C \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}$$. Check the solutions for the similar tutorial problems if you don't get it.

I'm not quite sure as to what you're referring to as there was no summary at the beginning of the Week-1 slides. But I guess I can add the questions covered at the beginning for easier reference.

I guess MA 105 questions are an Avengers' level threat, huh?  
However, question 9 is indeed a nice question in my opinion. So, [here](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-105-tut/blob/master/Additional%20solutions/S11-Q09.pdf) you have the solution for all parts.

Iron man is indeed correct. The typo has been fixed.

Surely Iron man shouldn't be having a problem with this.  
Anyway, [here's](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-105-tut/blob/master/Additional%20solutions/S10-Q11.pdf) the solution.

> "Can you please give the solution to Q7 Sheet 8?"  
> \- Freshie 

I *can* and I shall.  
By symmetry, the given volume is 8 times the volume in the positive octant.  
In that octant the volume lies above the region $$Q := \{(x, y, 0) \in \mathbb{R}^3 :x \ge 0, y \ge 0, x^2 + y^2 \le a^2\}$$ and underneath the cylinder given by $$x^2 + z^2 = a^2$$.  
Therefore,  
$$V = 8\displaystyle\int_0^a\left(\int_0^{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}\left(\int_0^{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}1dz\right)dy\right)dx = \dfrac{16a^3}{3}$$.

You're welcome!  
P.S.: Nothing is stopping you from making your own solutions for your own batch. I'm sure that there are plenty of subjects for which solutions aren't being made.

> "Can a continuous function with bounded and open domain be. integrable "  
> \- A person who is going to revolutionize whole world 

Yes, it *can*. But it's not necessary. This is because a continuous function need not be bounded on a bounded and open domain. (Think of an example.)  
Hence, the function won't be integrable.

> "What about question 7 of tut sheet 6? what do they mean by bounded in a disc?"  
> \- CuriousFreshie  

Hello, what the question means is that given any $$\epsilon > 0$$ and any $$M \in \mathbb{R}$$, there will be a point $$(x_0, y_0)$$ in the disc of radius $$\epsilon$$ centered at origin such that the value of $$\mid f_x(x_0, y_0)\mid$$ is greater than $$M$$. (This is what is means for the derivative to *not* be *bounded* in any disc around $$(0, 0)$$.)

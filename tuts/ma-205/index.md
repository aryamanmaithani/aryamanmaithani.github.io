In the following, I post two links for PDFs. One opens the PDF in GitHub. Here, you can't select text but this is nice for mobile even without downloading it.  
The in-browser works nicely on laptop/desktop by opening the file within your browser. However, on phones, it'll lead to a download.

Unlike previous semesters, I'm not going to make one every week. I'll just keep updating this file. (The file has a time stamp of last update.)

### Dark mode
The same file is also available in dark mode, for the nocturnals.

In the following, I post two links for PDFs. One opens the PDF in GitHub. Here, you can't select text but this is nice for mobile even without downloading it.  
The in-browser works nicely on laptop/desktop by opening the file within your browser. However, on phones, it'll lead to a download.

These are the PDFs I make while giving online tutorials. It is advisable to find the videos in the MS Teams for better reference. For $$\LaTeX$$'d solutions of this year's offering, you can check [Ishan Kapnadak's solutions](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/MA205/tut-solutions.pdf).

Unlike previous semesters, I'm not going to make one every week. I'll just keep updating this file. (The file has a time stamp of last update. Moreover, if I update something from earlier, I will usually mark it in blue.)  

### Dark mode
The same file is also available in dark mode, for the nocturnals.

## My old notes
I had not taken this course but rather, the "big boi" version of this - MA 412. Interested students may find (part of) my notes from that course [here](/math/ma-412).

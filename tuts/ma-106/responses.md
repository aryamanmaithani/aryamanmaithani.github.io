Well, this depends mainly on what the purpose of asking this question.  
If you want to know from the point of view of exams/grades, then I guess it's fine even if you don't read anything extra.  
If it's from the perspective of learning more, then well, it never hurts.

I'm not very sure as to what your confusion is.  
Tutorial 3 question 4 does address the relation between ranks of matrices and their product.  
Moreover, using question 1 you can recover also get more information.  
If there's something more particular that you want, you may drop another comment. Meanwhile, if I can think of something useful to post, I shall do so.

I can but I won't. We have been told to not give solutions. I do upload hints for the tutorial questions, though.
I will not do that for extra questions as it'll be too time consuming for me as well. Plus, you should attempt them yourself and ask your TA (or mail me) if you have doubts.

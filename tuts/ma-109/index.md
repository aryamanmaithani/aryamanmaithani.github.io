In the following, I post two links for PDFs. One opens the PDF in GitHub. Here, you can't select text but this is nice for mobile even without downloading it.  
The in-browser works nicely on laptop/desktop by opening the file within your browser. However, on phones, it'll lead to a download.

## Tutorial Solutions $$(\LaTeX)$$
#### Light mode: [In-GitHub PDF Link](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-109-tut/blob/master/tut-solutions.pdf) | [In-browser PDF Link](https://aryamanmaithani.github.io/ma-109-tut/tut-solutions.pdf)
#### Dark mode: [In-GitHub PDF Link](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-109-tut/blob/master/tut-solutions-dark.pdf) | [In-browser PDF Link](https://aryamanmaithani.github.io/ma-109-tut/tut-solutions-dark.pdf)

I'm not going to make a new one every week. I'll just keep updating this file. (The file has a time stamp of last update. Moreover, if I update something from earlier, I will usually mark it in blue.)  

You may also want to see my [older tutorial solutions](/tuts/ma-105).

## Handwritten Solutions
These are the PDFs I make while giving online tutorials. It is advisable to find the videos in the MS Teams for better reference.

I'm just putting all the links here so I don't have to update website weekly. The links will only point to actual content after that week's tutorial.

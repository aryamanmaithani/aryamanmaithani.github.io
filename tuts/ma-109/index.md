In the following, I post two links for PDFs. One opens the PDF in GitHub. Here, you can't select text but this is nice for mobile even without downloading it.  
The in-browser works nicely on laptop/desktop by opening the file within your browser. However, on phones, it'll lead to a download.

## Handwritten Solutions
These are the PDFs I make while giving online tutorials. It is advisable to find the videos in the MS Teams for better reference.

## Notes
### [PDF](/math/ma-108/MA-108-methods.pdf)
Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it looks like this course had to be brought to an abrupt end. However, I believe that this is quite an important course and thus, students should still learn it. However, I understand that one may not feel motivated enough to go through all the [notes posted by the course instructor](http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~preeti/ma108-2019/) and thus, I have written a compilation of my own.  
This does not go in depth as much as the notes but summarises all the methods one would have learnt in the course.

There is no Week 2 or later due to the pandemic.

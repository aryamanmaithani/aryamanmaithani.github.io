\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{defn}[Linear differential equations]
	A first order differential equation of the type
	\[\dfrac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = g(x)\]
	is called a \defin{linear differential equation} in standard form.
\end{defn}
We shall assume that $p(x)$ and $g(x)$ are continuous on an open interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}.$\\
\begin{mdframed}[style=boxstyle, frametitle={Solving such an ODE}]
	Verify that $\exp\left(\displaystyle\int p(x) dx\right)$ is an integrating factor of the above ODE.\\
	Thus, we can now turn back to technique of the previous section.

\subsection{Bernoulli's DE}
\begin{defn}[Bernoulli's DE]
	A first order differential equation of the type
	\[\dfrac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)y^n\]
	is called a \defin{Bernoulli's differential equation}.
\end{defn}
Note that if $n = 0$ or $1,$ then it is a linear DE as well and we already know how to solve that. Thus, we assume that $n \notin \{0, 1\}.$
\newpage
\begin{mdframed}[style=boxstyle, frametitle={Solving such an ODE}]
	Substitute \[u(x) = \dfrac{1}{y^{n-1}}.\]
	Calculate the derivative and rearrange the original ODE to obtain:
	\[\dfrac{1}{1 - n}\dfrac{du}{dx} + p(x)u(x) = q(x).\]
	Now, we are back to the case of a linear DE which we can solve.

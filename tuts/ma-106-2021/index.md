# Spring 2021
[Last year's page](/tuts/ma-106).

In the following, I post two links for PDFs. One opens the PDF in GitHub. Here, you can't select text but this is nice for mobile even without downloading it.  
The in-browser works nicely on laptop/desktop by opening the file within your browser. However, on phones, it'll lead to a download.

A collection of some things I find cool.

## Websites
* [Notpron](http://notpron.org/notpron/) - Supposedly the hardest game on the internet. Over 19 million visitors since August 2004 but only 67 people have solved it so far.
* [The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/) - a game that shows how trust works; via game theory, of course.

## Videos
I like many videos of [Tom Scott](https://tomscott.com). Here are some favourites:
* [This Video Has n Views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0): "The title of this video should change with the times. But nothing lasts forever: here's the story of how I made it work, why it used to be easier to make that work, and how it all ties in to the White Cliffs of Dover and the end of the universe."
* [Whatever Happened to Tom's Hoodie?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYd_8-Ps_kw): a video about digital-ising a physical object that carries sentiment.

## Math related
* A poster of [The Periodic Table of Finite Simple Groups](https://i.redd.it/gn5cimd92mh11.jpg)

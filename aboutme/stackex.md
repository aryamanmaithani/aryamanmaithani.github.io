Here is a list of some questions from [Math StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com){:target="_blank"}. These are not particularly tough questions but ones I find nice. (And want to keep them here for quick reference.)

# My answers

### galois-theory

0. [If $$K/\mathbb{Q}$$ is finite, then there exists a finite extension $$E/K$$ which is not normal](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4184243/427810){:target="_blank"}

0. [An elementary way of counting the number of generators of $$\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$ over $$\mathbb{F}_{q}$$](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4087728/427810){:target="_blank"}  
Interestingly, a similar question came up in a test I gave few months later. I started doing it in a more complicated way (similar to my other answer on that question) but then I remembered I had done this special case in an easier way on this post.

0. [Computing the Galois group of $$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[6]{-3})/\mathbb{Q}$$](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4169160/427810){:target="_blank"}

### group-theory

0. [Is the subgroup of divisible elements a divisible a subgroup?](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4264722/427810){:target="_blank"}  
At the time of writing this, this is probably the answer I consider to be my best one.

### commutative-algebra

0. [Is $$\arctan(2)$$ a rational multiple of $$\pi$$?](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4272329/427810){:target="_blank"}  
While the question doesn't look like it belongs in this tag, my answer solves it using unique factorisation in the domain $$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-1}]$$.

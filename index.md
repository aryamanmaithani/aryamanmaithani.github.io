Hello, you have reached [my](/aboutme) website.  
This website is mainly for the compilation of my academic work. Use the navigation bar to see more.  

If you are a first year student of IIT Bombay, you will most likely be interested in my resources for MA 106, which can be found [here](/tuts/ma-106/).  
If you are a second year student, you might be interested in either the [MA 214](notes/ma-214) or the [CS 213](/notes/cs-213) page.  

You may also be interested in checking out [Student Seminar in Mathematics Department, IITB](https://student-seminar-math-iitb.github.io), an initiative of mine and [Som Phene](https://somphene.github.io)'s.

Hello, you have reached [my](/aboutme) personal website.  
I have attempted to make it somewhat disjoint from my "professional"/"academic" website, which is [here](/math). 

If you are an IITB student, [this link](/tuts) is probably what you are looking for. Some other helpful resources are linked below. Have fun!

If you have something to tell and wish to do so anonymously, you may drop a message [here]({{ site.anon-form }}){:target="blank"}. [Here](/responses) are my responses to (some of) your messages.


# Links
## Math
* [Math stuff](/math)
* [Groups](/alg/groups) - this should probably be there somewhere in the above website but I haven't gotten around to it yet

## Academic
* [Notes](/notes) - these are non-math notes
* [Tutorials](/tuts), pages I made while TA'ing for courses at IITB
* [IITB Resources](/iitb-resources), collection of notes/tutorial solutions I made for various courses

## Tutorials, of sorts

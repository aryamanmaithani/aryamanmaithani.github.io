Hello, you have reached [my](/aboutme) website.  
This website is mainly for the compilation of my academic work. Use the navigation bar to see more.  

If you are a first year student of IIT Bombay, you will most likely be interested in my resources for MA 108, which can be found [here](/tuts/ma-108/).  
Else, you might be interested in the following pages: 
* [MA 214](/notes/ma-214)
* [CS 213](/notes/cs-213)
* [HS 101](/notes/hs-101)
* [HS 200](/notes/hs-200)  
These are (some of the) courses that I am taking currently. For these, I've been making e-notes and uploading them regularly.

You may also be interested in checking out [Student Seminar in Mathematics Department, IITB](https://student-seminar-math-iitb.github.io), an initiative of mine and [Som Phene](https://somphene.github.io)'s.

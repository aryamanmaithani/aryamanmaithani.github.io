Participated in the Polymath Jr. collaborative mathematical research program for undergraduates. We examined the Betti tables of quadratic ideals with three generators in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_{2}[x, y, z]$ and resolved all these ideals using theoretical results as well as Macaulay2. We have plans to submit our work for publication in early 2022.

I also presented this work in the Young Mathematicians Conference organized by the Ohio State University. The video can be found \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax-zScZtL7Q}{here}.

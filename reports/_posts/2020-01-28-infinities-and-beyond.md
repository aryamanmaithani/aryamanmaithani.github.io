#### [PDF](/files/Infinities and beyond.pdf)  
The document contains some results and their proofs about cardinalities that I found interesting. The report is not self-contained in the sense that I don't define what cardinal numbers are and I skip proofs regarding their arithmetic.  
A nice thing about this document is that I keep track of which arguments use the Axiom of Choice and which ones don't.

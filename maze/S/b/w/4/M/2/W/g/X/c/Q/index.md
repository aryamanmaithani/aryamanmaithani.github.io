Hello, traveller.  
You made eleven choices that led you here.  
Alas, one or more of them were wrong. You must begin afresh.  
Hopefully you make the correct set of 11 choices. After all, there are _only_ 2046 other wrong choices.

Now, you may be asking yourself - _is it worth it?_  
Well, you won't get a certificate. You could mail me and I could put your name somewhere. What is the point, though? Not much.  
However, you would know that you completed it. You'd have the satisfaction of cracking it. Maybe that is worth it.  
Or maybe it isn't. What do I know? I just put it together a lazy evening because I had nothing better to do. This is not even too tough to crack. No reason to trust me.

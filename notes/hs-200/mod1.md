## Lecture 1 (2nd March 2020)
* In ES 200, we were introduced to the ecological and health aspects.
* In HS 200, we look at the the philosophical/social aspects.
* Note: Next Monday, 9th March is a holiday
* Three components:
    - Economics
    - Social
    - Philosophical
* We'll have only one end-semester exam → April. Fifty mark exam, ninety minutes. Completely objective type. Multiple choice, T/F, FIB.
    - Approximately same weight-age for all parts. 17 + 17 + 16 in some order.
    - Questions from slides, classroom discussion, reading material uploaded on Moodle. For social part → short videos will be shown. Questions based on those videos as well.

Some concerns:

* Global warming → ice caps melting → coastal cities are in danger. We keep hearing news about "xyz city will be underwater by 20XY."
    - It is a fact that ocean levels are rising.
* CFCs bad. Plastic in water.
    - Prof read in paper: "Sample testing conducted in India. The salt we have contains a large number of micro-plastics." Bad for health.
* Landfills → cause degradation to soil quality.
* We also have resource depletion:
    - Deforestation. E.g., Amazon fires
    - Overfishing

Now we see economic concepts to understand the problems.
1. Externality: In particular, negative externality.  
    We know that dumping stuff in rivers is bad. Why do factories still do it then? Why are the authorities not being able to stop these issues?
2. Free Rider Problem: Pertaining to public goods. (Not private.)  
    Public goods: People tend to utilise it in a bad way/carelessly as compared to if it were a private good. (Prof might even throw in some Game Theory.)
3. "Cake-eating problem" → something in macro eco. Essentially a dynamic programming problem. Want to maximise something which is changing dynamically. _You have a cake, how much do you eat it everyday to maximise happiness?_  
    Suppose you have a forest. How much of the trees will you cut down?  
    If you cut all, then gone. If you leave some, it can regrow.  
    The theme: _What you save today, you use as capital tomorrow._  
    Saving stuff: gives more for tomorrow  
    Consumption: gives happiness now :)  
    Economists have been seen to be more worried about consumption.  
    If you offer someone 100 for either today or tomorrow, they'll take it today. To convince them to take it tomorrow, you must offer something strictly greater for tomorrow.  
    That's how a fixed deposit works.  
    If you don't think about tomorrow, you take more than the resources are there.  
    Examples: Overfishing. Hilsa fish in Bangladesh. Very popular, almost went extinct due to fishermen. Government stepped in and has stopped fishing for 7-8 months. This was a public good.   
    Everyone thinks: "If I don't catch it, someone else will. So, what's the point? I'll only fish." A sort of prisoner's dilemma. The better option would be that no one fishes. But that does not happen. (Nash equilibrium.) → Coordination issue

#### What is needed?
* Write some function that maximises not only current profit but also future. Could be an infinite time horizon → "overlapping generation models." You get requests from your "parents" and leave requests for your "children." Times T-1 and T+1 are also considered.  
* Economics and environments are interlinked now → Has been noticed that economic incentives make people work. You may educate people however you want but they (most) won't care a lot unless you give money.
    - Might subsidise companies who use cleaner methods. E.g., organic instead of harmful pesticides.


#### Interdisciplinary
* The course deals with the economic aspect → incentivise people. Socio-psychological aspects → "behavioural economics". warm-glow effect/altruism: do something good for society/charity, it gives you a fillup. (Utility is increased.) This was never considered in economics earlier. But now we incorporate this as well.  
On the other hand, we also have jealousy. Experiments in Game theory where they might even harm themselves (monetarily) to not face something else psychologically.  

To look at an effective solution, we must look at all aspects.  
* We have presidents and prime ministers even claim that there's no climate change.

This disparity happens because of difference in discount-rates: People have different opinions of future needs. They don't care about 2070. People not willing to look that far ahead. They just care about maximising current input.  
Prof's personal opinion: this is the biggest hurdle.  

#### Contours
Suppose you want to convince an agriculturalist to take something organically better → even though the new technology is costlier and yield is not as much. (Micro issue)  
Macro: How do you design trade pacts? Suppose there's a country which only wants clean tech but some other one does not care at all. How do you maintain that your agents continue using clean tech. The problem is that often these clean techs are costlier and less efficient. You have to incentivise people somehow to continue using clean.  

#### Issues
Clean techs costlier but long term benefits. Dirty techs will lead to future depletion of nutrients. Question of cost benefit analysis.  

Need a concept of environmental audit → to make good policies.  

Some countries: Give a deadline that we'll cut down to 30%-40% by some deadline. There's a tussle. You have to keep your growth levels but also protecc environment.  

__Mechanism design, correlation matrices__. → game theory concepts.  

Prof explains the prisoner's dilemma. Due to miscoordination, we reach an equilibrium which isn't actually the best.  
Same in the case as fishermen. Maybe if they all underfished, they could actually gain. (Since supply is low.) But this requires all of them to trust and sacrifice. If there's an incentive to cheat → they will :(  
Monitoring is very costly or just not possible. Thus, everyone goes for their own best.  
Thus, even talking it out can't help. 

Next class: A bit of game theory.

I had starting making this PDF as a compilation of formulae/algorithms for quick access as compared to going through the slides.  
Due to this, the notes don't contain theory.  
Ergo, don't treat them as an alternative to the slides.  

* [PDF](notes.pdf)
Note that this is updated from time to time. Check the date of the PDF to see the last date of updation.

I shall also post the solutions of the _theoretical_ tutorial questions.  
* [Tutorial 1](tut-01.pdf): Questions 2 and 5
* [Tutorial 2](tut-02.pdf): Questions 1 and 4
* [Tutorial 3](tut-03.pdf): Questions 1 and 4

If you have any corrections regarding the notes and/or tutorial solutions, kindly [mail me](mailto:aryamanmaithani@gmail.com) at aryamanmaithani@gmail.com.

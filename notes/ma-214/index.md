I had starting making this PDF as a compilation of formulae/algorithms for quick access as compared to going through the slides.  
Due to this, the notes don't contain theory.  
Ergo, don't treat them as an alternative to the slides.  

* [PDF](notes.pdf)
Note that this is updated from time to time. Check the date of the PDF to see the last date of updation. I've now also started adding the last lecture until which the notes have been updated. (Hopefully, I won't forget to update that.)

I shall also post the solutions of the _theoretical_ tutorial questions.  
* [Tutorial 1](tut-01.pdf): Questions 2 and 5
* [Tutorial 2](tut-02.pdf): Questions 1 and 4
* [Tutorial 3](tut-03.pdf): Questions 1 and 4
* [Tutorial 4](tut-04.pdf): Question 4
* [Tutorial 5](tut-05.pdf): Question 4
* [Tutorial 6](tut-06.pdf): All questions
* [Tutorial 7](tut-06.pdf): Questions 1, 2, and 4

If you have any corrections regarding the notes and/or tutorial solutions, kindly [mail me](mailto:aryamanmaithani@gmail.com) at aryamanmaithani@gmail.com.  
Alternately, you may drop a message anonymously [here](https://forms.gle/dYNWHtemQB2yURvX7).  
To those who are using the above form to demand solutions of all tutorial questions - I shall not be doing that. The reason is simple: they are direct questions for which you already have solved examples in slides.

Clicking on the course you want will take you to its **webpage**.  
There, you'll find a description of the files and folders of documents related to the course.  
Clicking on the hyperlink of any file/folder will take you to its GitHub page.  
If it is a file, you will see that there's a "Download" button. If it is a folder, you can then open the files individually and download the one(s) that you want.

Alternately, there's a button on the **webpage** that lets you download all the contents in the form a ZIP file.

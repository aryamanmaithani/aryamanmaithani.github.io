> Q. Where have you seen trees?

* Someone: circuit diagram  
* Famous example: family tree. Could start with myself as root and branches are parents and so on. Can do it the other way around as well. Start with two important people like King X and Queen Y, then write their offsprings.  
* Decision tree. Flowchart of decisions. Helps in taking actions.  
* Game tree. 
    - Tournaments → leagues, semi-finals, finals. 
    - Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, et cetera. AI uses this. (Making best possible decision.)  
* File system in Linux/Ubuntu. Tree or not?
    - In a tree, every node should have a unique parent.
        + However, if we allow file sharing, the same file can come in two directories → then, it's not a tree.
        + Linux _does_ allow you to share, though. So, not a tree. (`ln` command helps you link.)

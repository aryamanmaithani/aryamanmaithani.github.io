* Infinite group $$G$$ such that every proper subgroup is finite.  
* Infinite group containing every finite group as subgroup.  
* Proper subgroup of $$(\mathbb{R}, +)$$ of finite index.  
* Infinite group must have proper subgroup.  
* Group structure on every set.  
* (Q, +), (Q>0, x), (Q-{0}, x), (Z, +) iso  
* (R, +), (C, +) iso  
* (RxQ, +), (R, +) iso

* tukey's lem, zorn's, haus maximal chain, well order, ac  
* (|X| = \infty \implies |X^2| = |X|) \iff AC  
* (G set \implies \exists f (G, f) is group) \iff AC  
** group (and ring) by symmetric difference, product thing 
* AC \implies (\epsilon-\delta \iff seq continuity)  
* AC \implies (|A| = \infty \implies |~N| \le |A|)  
* |S| = |{F \subset S : |F| < \infty}|

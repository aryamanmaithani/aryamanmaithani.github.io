Let $$G$$ be a group with order 120. We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
Note that $$|G| = 2^3\cdot3\cdot5$$.  
Let us assume that $$G$$ is simple and arrive at a contradiction.  
By Sylow Theorem (3), we see that $$n_5 \mid 24$$ and $$n_5 \equiv 1 \mod 5$$. Looking at the divisors of $$24$$, we see that $$n_5 = 6.$$  ($$n_5 \neq 1$$ by our assumption of simplicity.)  

Let $$G$$ act on Syl$$_5(g)$$ by conjugation.  
This gives a natural homomorphism $$m : G \to S_6.$$  

By transitivity of the action, we know that ker $$m \neq G.$$ However, $$G$$ is simple by assumption and kernel is a normal subgroup. Thus, ker $$m = (1).$$  
This gives us that $$G$$ is isomorphic to a subgroup $$H$$ of $$S_6.$$ (To be precise, $$H = m(G).$$)  

In fact, more is true. As $$\vert H\vert > 2$$ and $$H$$ is simple, we also have that $$H \le A_6.$$ (See the proof of [121](/alg/groups/simple/121) for the similar result and its proof.)  

Now, consider the set of cosets $$A_6/H.$$ (This will not be a group but that is okay.)  
Note that $$|H| = 120$$ and $$A_6 = 6!/2 = 360$$ and hence, $$|A_6/H| = 3.$$
Let $$A_6$$ act on $$A_6/H$$ by left multiplication. Once again, this is a transitive action and thus the kernel of the corresponding homomorphism $$m' : A_6 \to S_3$$ is a proper subgroup of $$A_6.$$  
As $$A_6$$ is simple, it forces that ker $$m' = (1).$$ However, this is not possible as $$|A_6| = 120 < 6 = |S_3|.$$ Thus, we have arrived a contradiction and we are done!  

Note: We have used the fact that $$A_n$$ is simple for $$n \ge 5.$$  
The last contradiction was using the fact that ker $$m' = (1)$$ would imply that $$m'$$ is injective.

Let $$G$$ be a group with order 132. We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
Note that $$|G| = 2^2\cdot3\cdot11$$.  
Let us assume that $$G$$ is simple and arrive at a contradiction. By simplicity, we know that $$n_{11} > 1, n_3 > 1,$$ and $$n_2 > 1.$$  
By Sylow Theorem (3), it is forced that $$n_{11} = 12.$$ Also, $$n_3 \ge 4$$ and $$n_2 \ge 3.$$  

Note the following:
1. Intersection of any two Sylow-$$11$$ subgroups is trivial.  
2. Intersection of any two Sylow-$$3$$ subgroups is trivial.  
3. Intersection of any Sylow-$$p$$ subgroup with any Sylow-$$q$$ subgroup is trivial.

The above facts follow by considering the fact that the intersection would be a subgroup of the two bigger subgroups and would have to divide their orders.  

Now, if we consider the union of all the Sylow-$$11$$ and Sylow-$$3$$ subgroups, it contains at least $$12(11-1) + 4(3-1) + 1 = 129$$ elements. Thus, the remaining elements are at most $$3.$$ However, we do need at least $$3$$ more elements to form a Sylow-$$2$$ subgroup.  
These $$3$$ elements, along with the identity must form the unique Sylow-$$2$$ subgroup of order $$4.$$  
However, we have reached a contradiction as we get that $$n_2 = 1.$$  
Thus, we are done!

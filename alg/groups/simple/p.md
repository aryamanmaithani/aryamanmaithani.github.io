Let $$p$$ be any prime number.  
Let $$G$$ be a group with order $$p$$.  
Let $$H$$ be any subgroup of $$G$$. Then, by Lagrange's Theorem, $$|H|$$ must divide $$p$$ and thus, $$|H|=1$$ or $$|H|=p$$. In either case, we get that $$H$$ is a trivial subgroup of $$G$$.  
Thus, $$G$$ is simple and there is no nontrivial normal subgroup of $$G$$.  

Thus, any group with prime order is simple.

Let $$G$$ be a group of order $$168.$$  
Then, $$G$$ may or may not be simple.  

For example, $$G = \mathbb{Z}/168\mathbb{Z}$$ is an example of a non-simple group of order $$168.$$ This can be easily verified by considering the subgroup $$H = \{0, 84\} \le G.$$ This is clearly normal as $$G$$ is abelian.

On the other hand, see [this](http://www-math.ucdenver.edu/~tvis/Coursework/Fano.pdf) paper for the existence as well as uniqueness of a simple group of order $$168.$$

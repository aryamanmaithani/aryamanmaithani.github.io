Let $$G$$ be a group with order 198. We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
Note that $$|G| = 2\cdot3^2\cdot11$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (3), we see that $$n_{11} \mid 18$$ and $$n_{11} \equiv 1 \mod 11$$. Looking at the divisors of $$18$$, we see that $$n_{11} = 1$$ is the only option and hence, we are done.

Let $$G$$ be a group of order $$mp^n$$ where $$p$$ is a prime, $$m$$ is a positive integer with $$1 < m < p.$$ We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
By Sylow Theorem (3), $$n_p \mid m$$ and $$n_p \equiv 1 \mod p$$.  
This means that $$n_p = 1 + kp$$ for some $$k \in \mathbb{Z}^+\cup\{0\}$$. However, $$m < p$$ forces $$k = 0$$. Thus, $$n_p = 1$$ and we are done.

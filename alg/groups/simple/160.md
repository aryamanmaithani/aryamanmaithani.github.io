Let $$G$$ be a group with order 160. We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
Note that $$|G| = 2^5\cdot5$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (3), we get that $$n_2 \in \{1, 5\}.$$
#### Case 1. $$n_2 = 1$$
Then, we are done.
#### Case 2. $$n_2 = 5$$
Let $$G$$ act on Syl$$_2(G) = \{P_1, \ldots, P_5\}$$ by conjugation.  
Consider the corresponding natural homomorphism $$m:G\to S_5$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (2), ker $$m \neq G$$ as the action is transitive.  
Assume ker $$m = (1).$$ Then, $$m$$ is an injective map and thus, $$m(G)$$ has $$160$$ elements. However $$m(G) \le S_5$$ and $$|S_5| = 5!$$, a contradiction as $$160\not\mid5!.$$ This shows us that ker $$m$$ cannot be $$(1).$$  

Thus, ker $$m$$ is a proper nontrivial subgroup of $$G.$$  
As kernels of homomorphisms are always normal, we are done!

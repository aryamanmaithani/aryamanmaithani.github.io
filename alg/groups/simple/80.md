Let $$G$$ be a group with order 80. We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
Note that $$|G| = 2^4\cdot5$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (3), we see that $$n_5 \mid 16$$ and $$n_5 \equiv 1 \mod 5$$. Looking at the divisors of $$16,$$ we see that $$n_5 = 1$$ or $$n_5 = 16.$$
#### Case 1. $$n_5 = 1$$
Then, we are done.
#### Case 2. $$n_5 = 16$$
Thus, there are $$16$$ Sylow-$$7$$ subgroups of $$G$$. Now, note that each such Sylow-$$5$$ subgroup has order $$5$$, a prime and thus, the intersection of two distinct Sylow-$$5$$ subgroups must be trivial, id est, $$(1)$$. Thus, the number of elements having order $$5$$ equals $$16(5-1) = 64.$$  
This leaves us with $$16$$ remaining elements which are not part of any Sylow-$$5$$ subgroup.  
Now, by Sylow Theorem (1), we know that $$n_2 \ge 1$$. However, no non-identity element can be part of a Sylow-$$2$$ as well as a Sylow-$$5$$ subgroup. Thus, the remaining $$16$$ elements form the unique Sylow-$$2$$ subgroup which gives us that $$n_2 = 1$$ and thus, we are done.

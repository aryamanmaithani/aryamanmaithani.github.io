Let $$G$$ be a group with order 56. We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
Note that $$|G| = 2^3\cdot7$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (3), we see that $$n_7 \mid 8$$ and $$n_7 \equiv 1 \mod 7$$. Looking at the divisors of $$8,$$ we see that $$n_7 = 1$$ or $$n_7 = 8.$$
#### Case 1. $$n_7 = 1$$
Then, we are done.
#### Case 2. $$n_7 = 8$$
Thus, there are $$8$$ Sylow-$$7$$ subgroups of $$G$$. Now, note that each such Sylow-$$7$$ subgroup has order $$7$$, a prime and thus, the intersection of two distinct Sylow-$$7$$ subgroups must be trivial, id est, $$(1)$$. Thus, the number of elements having order $$7$$ equals $$8(7-1) = 48.$$  
This leaves us with $$8$$ remaining elements which are not part of any Sylow-$$7$$ subgroup.  
Now, by Sylow Theorem (1), we know that $$n_2 \ge 1$$. However, no non-identity element can be part of a Sylow-$$2$$ as well as a Sylow-$$7$$ subgroup. Thus, the remaining $$8$$ elements form the unique Sylow-$$2$$ subgroup which gives us that $$n_2 = 1$$ and thus, we are done.

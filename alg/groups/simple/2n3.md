Let $$G$$ be a group with order $$2^n\cdot3$$ where $$n$$ is a positive integer strictly greater than 1. We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
By Sylow Theorem (3), we see that $$n_2 \mid 3$$ and thus, we have the following two cases:
#### Case 1. $$n_2 = 1$$
Then, we are done.
#### Case 2. $$n_2 = 3$$
Then, $$G$$ acts on Syl$$_2(G) = \{P_1, P_2, P_3\}$$ by conjugation.  
Consider the corresponding natural homomorphism $$m:G\to S_3$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (2), ker $$m \neq G$$ as the action is transitive.  
Assume ker $$m = (1)$$. Then, $$m$$ is an injective map and thus, $$m(G)$$ has $$2^n\cdot 3 \ge 12$$ elements. However $$m(G) \le S_3$$ and $$|S_3| = 6$$, a contradiction.  
Thus, ker $$m$$ is a proper nontrivial subgroup of $$G$$.  
As kernels of homomorphisms are always normal, we are done.

Let $$G$$ be a group with order 150. We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
Note that $$|G| = 2\cdot3\cdot5^2$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (3), we get that $$n_5 \in \{1, 6\}.$$
#### Case 1. $$n_5 = 1$$
Then, we are done.
#### Case 2. $$n_5 = 6$$
Let $$G$$ act on Syl$$_5(G) = \{P_1, \ldots, P_6\}$$ by conjugation.  
Consider the corresponding natural homomorphism $$m:G\to S_6$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (2), ker $$m \neq G$$ as the action is transitive.  
Assume ker $$m = (1).$$ Then, $$m$$ is an injective map and thus, $$m(G)$$ has $$150$$ elements. However $$m(G) \le S_6$$ and $$|S_6| = 6!$$, a contradiction as $$150\not\mid6!.$$ This shows us that ker $$m$$ cannot be $$(1).$$  

Thus, ker $$m$$ is a proper nontrivial subgroup of $$G.$$  
As kernels of homomorphisms are always normal, we are done!

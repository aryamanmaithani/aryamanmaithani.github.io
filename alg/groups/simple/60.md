Let $$G$$ be a group of order $$60.$$  
Then, $$G$$ may or may not be simple.  

For example, $$G = \mathbb{Z}/60\mathbb{Z}$$ is an example of a non-simple group of order $$60.$$ This can be easily verified by considering the subgroup $$H = \{0, 30\} \le G.$$ This is clearly normal as $$G$$ is abelian.

On the other hand, consider $$G = A_5,$$ the alternating group of degree $$5.$$ It is known that $$A_n$$ is simple for $$n \ge 5.$$ Thus, $$G$$ is simple and moreover, it has order $$5!/2 = 60.$$

Interestingly, it can be shown that $$A_5$$ is the _only_ simple group (up to isomorphism) of order $$60.$$

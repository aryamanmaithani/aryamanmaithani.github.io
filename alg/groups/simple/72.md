Let $$G$$ be a group with order 72. We show that $$G$$ is not simple.  
Note that $$|G| = 2^3\cdot3^2$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (3), we see that $$n_3 \mid 8$$ and $$n_3 \equiv 1 \mod 3$$. Looking at the divisors of $$8,$$ we see that $$n_3 = 1$$ or $$n_3 = 4.$$
#### Case 1. $$n_3 = 1$$
Then, we are done.
#### Case 2. $$n_3 = 4$$
Thus, there are $$4$$ Sylow-$$3$$ subgroups of $$G$$, each of size $$9.$$  
Syl$$_3(G) = \{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\}.$$
Let $$G$$ act on Syl$$_3(G)$$ by conjugation.  
Consider the corresponding natural homomorphism $$m:G\to S_4$$.  
By Sylow Theorem (2), ker $$m \neq G$$ as the action is transitive.  
Assume ker $$m = (1)$$. Then, $$m$$ is an injective map and thus, $$m(G)$$ has $$72$$ elements. However $$m(G) \le S_4$$ and $$|S_4| = 24$$, a contradiction.  
Thus, ker $$m$$ is a proper nontrivial subgroup of $$G$$.  
As kernels of homomorphisms are always normal, we are done.

> Let $$G$$ be a group such that $$x^2 = 1$$ for every $$x \in G$$. We show that $$G$$ is abelian.  

(Note that technically the title is incorrect as the identity obviously does not have order 2.)  
Let $$x$$ and $$y$$ be any two elements of $$G$$. We show that $$xy = yx$$.  
By hypothesis, $$(xy)^2 = 1$$.  
$$\implies xyxy = 1$$  
$$\implies xyxyy = y$$  
$$\implies xyx = y \quad (\because y^2 = 1)$$  
$$\implies xyxx = yx$$  
$$\implies xy = yx. \quad \blacksquare$$

> Let $$p$$ be any prime number and let $$n \ge 1$$ be an integer.  
> Let $$G$$ be a group with order $$p^n$$. We show that $$Z(G)$$ is not trivial.  

Suppose not. That is, $$Z(G) = (1)$$.  
Consider the [class equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugacy_class#Conjugacy_class_equation) of $$G$$. The size of any nontrivial orbit will be of the form $$p^{m}$$ for some $$1 \le m \le n$$. (By orbit-stabiliser theorem.) Thus, we get:  
$$|G| = p^n = 1 + p^{a_1} + \cdots + p^{a_k}$$  
However, this is a contradiction as the right hand side of the equation is not divisible by $$p.$$ QED.

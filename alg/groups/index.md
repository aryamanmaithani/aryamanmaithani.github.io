## Some cool results
* [Let $$G$$ be a group such that $$a^2 = 1$$ for every $$a \in G,$$ then $$G$$ is abelian](every-element-has-order-2)
* [Let $$G$$ be a group of order $$p^n,$$ where $$p$$ is a prime and $$n \in \mathbb{Z}^+.$$ Then, $$Z(G)$$ is nontrivial.](p-group-nontrivial-center)
* [Any group of order $$p^2$$ for prime $$p$$ is abelian.](p2-groups-abelian)
* [Any group of order $$pq$$ where $$p \nmid q - 1$$ is cyclic.](pq-cyclic-group) (Of course, $$p$$ and $$q$$ are primes as usual.)
* [If $$G/Z(G)$$ is cyclic, then $$G$$ is abelian.](GZ-cyclic-abelian)

## Sylow
* [This](simple) is where I've posted most of content related to groups.  
I have classified groups of order $$n$$ on the basis of their simplicity for $$n \le 200.$$
* [Exercise 4.5 of Dummit Foote](sylow-exercises).

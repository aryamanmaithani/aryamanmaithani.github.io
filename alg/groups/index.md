## Some cool results
* [Let $$G$$ be a group such that $$a^2 = 1$$ for every $$a \in G,$$ then $$G$$ is abelian](every-element-has-order-2)
* [Let $$G$$ be a group of order $$p^n,$$ where $$p$$ is a prime and $$n \in \mathbb{Z}^+.$$ Then, $$Z(G)$$ is nontrivial.](p-group-nontrivial-center)
* [Any group of order $$p^2$$ for prime $$p$$ is abelian.](p2-groups-abelian)

## Simple groups
[This](simple) is where I've posted most of content related to groups.  
I have classified groups of order $$n$$ on the basis of their simplicity for $$n \le 200.$$

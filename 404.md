# Whoah, that's a 404 Error!
This is _strange_ but the page you're trying to access doesn't exist. Unless you were trying to access the error page. In which case, here you are.  
Try [going back to the homepage](/), or use the sidebar on the left to find what you're looking for.  

## Did I bring you here?
In that case, there's a broken link somewhere! Please let me know, either via [email](mailto:aryamanmaithani@gmail.com) or via this [anonymous form]({{ site.anon-form }}){:target="_blank"}.

In case you've seen it all, here's a list of things one can do:
* build a rocket,
* fight a mummy,
* climb up the Eiffel Tower,
* discover something that doesn't exist,
* give a monkey a shower,
* surf tidal waves,
* create nanobots,
* locate Frankenstein's brain,
* find a dodo bird,
* paint a continent, or
* drive your sister insane.

As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do.

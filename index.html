  <h1>Hello.</h1>
  <p>I'm a website.</p>
  <p>I'm currently under construction.</p>
  <p>In the mean time, you may try to solve the following question:</p>
  <p>Find a function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with the following property: </br>
  $f$ is discontinuous everywhere but $\lim_{x \to a}f(x)$ exists for all $a \in \mathbb{R}.$</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If you think that such a function cannot exist, then prove it.</p>
  <p>If you have solved the problem, you may email your solution to aryamanmaithani@gmail.com</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Cheers!</p>

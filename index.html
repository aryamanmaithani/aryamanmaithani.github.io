<h1>Hello.</h1>
<p>I'm a website.</p>
<p>I'm currently under construction.</p>
<p>In the mean time, you may try to solve the following question:</p>
<p>Find a function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with the following property:</p>
<p>$f$ is discontinuous everywhere but $\lim_{x \to a}f(x)$ exists for all $a \in \mathbb{R}.$</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you think that such a fuction cannot exist, then prove it.</p>
<p>If you have solved the problem, you may email it to aryamanmaithani@gmail.com</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

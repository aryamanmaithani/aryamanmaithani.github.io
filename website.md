As should be evident, this website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The link should help you get started.  

The layout that I originally used was [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/). Now, I have added a lot more things so you probably can't even recognise Beautiful Jekyll. (In fact, I think it's only the original skeleton code that is the true Beautiful Jekyll.)

The [link](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) has a nice tutorial which you can follow to make your own website. You could, however, wish to use another layout. [Here](https://jekyll-themes.com/free/) is a list of many other (free) themes that you could use.

You can also find the source files for this website [here](https://www.github.com/aryamanmaithani/aryamanmaithani.github.io). You do have my permission to use whatever code you want. However, I would ___highly___ suggest you to use the layouts listed earlier. This is because I have made a huge amount of changes without any sort of documentation - this would likely lead to a lot of confusion. The code as of now has been put together quite sloppily from different places and I would assume that it would be a nightmare for a third person to figure it out.

A final suggestion - I assume that you too are an undergrad like me who's looking at this. If you want to make your website, just go with it and publish it. Don't try to wait until you have a lot of content to put up. That would most likely lead to you postponing it until forever. If you're making notes or working on some project, just upload the stuff that is in progress as well. This has been one of the pushing factors leading to me continuing to make notes, et cetera.

### Things I've bodged together
This is the list of themes/features I've taken the code of:
1. [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/)
2. [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/)
3. [Sidebar main](https://codepen.io/StephenScaff/pen/bVbEbJ)
4. [Sidebar picture feature](https://codepen.io/kazzkiq/pen/pvqvxO)
5. [Dark/light mode toggle feature](https://dev.to/ananyaneogi/create-a-dark-light-mode-switch-with-css-variables-34l8)

I'm a fan of Tom Scott's following philosophy - [bodging things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U).

## Warning
As mentioned before, I have put together code from a lot of places (maybe even quite sloppily) and without any documentation.  

You are probably going to be much better off if you don't take my files and start on your own.
